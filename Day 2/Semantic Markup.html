    <h1>Understanding Semantic Markup</h1>
    <p>Semantic markup refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning of the content within them. It helps both browsers and developers understand the structure and purpose of the web content.</p>
    <p>Using semantic markup improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. It allows search engines to better index the content and assistive technologies to provide a better user experience.</p>
    <p>Examples of semantic elements include tags that clearly define their content, such as headers, footers, articles, and sections. These tags provide context to the content they enclose, making it easier to understand and maintain.</p>
    <p>For instance, a tag that indicates a navigation menu helps screen readers announce it as a navigation section, aiding users in understanding the layout of the page. Similarly, a tag that denotes the main content of the page helps search engines prioritize the content during indexing.</p>
    <p>By using semantic markup, developers can create more meaningful and maintainable code. It also ensures that web pages are more accessible to users with disabilities, as assistive technologies can better interpret the content.</p>
    <p>In summary, semantic markup is a crucial aspect of modern web development that enhances the usability, accessibility, and searchability of web content.</p>
