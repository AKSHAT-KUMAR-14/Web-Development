    <h1>Subscript and Superscript in HTML</h1>
    <p>The <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. It is typically used for chemical formulas, like H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. It is typically used for footnotes, like this example<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of both tags used together:</p>
